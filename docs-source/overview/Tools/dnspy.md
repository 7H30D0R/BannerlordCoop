# Introduction

Download available [here](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases).

We use **dnspy** to view Bannerlord code as it can decompile, analyze, and debug dlls.<br/>
Bannerlord dlls can be opened using **dnspy** and are found in `{Bannerlord Directory}\bin\Win64_Shipping_Client`<br/>

# Using Dnspy

You can analyze existing code by right clicking on an object/method/variable and selecting analyze. <br/>

This allows you to trace where that code is being used and what is using it. <br/>
