# What is Github?
Github is a hub for software project development. We use it to organize and manage the development of the BannerlordCoop mod.

# How do we use it

Github Teams to organize repositories.<br/>
[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) to track features and bugs.<br/>
[Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards) to organize and track progress of issues.<br/>
[Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches) are used to isolate your coding progress, essentially branches are a copy of the base code.<br/>
[Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) are used to merge branches into the main branch. In our case that is the 'development' branch. Note: the master branch is used to release the mod.<br/>
